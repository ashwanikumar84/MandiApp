/**
 * Object:
 * A class describes structures that can be instantiated as and when desired and allows for as many
 * instances as needed, an object instead represents a single static instance,
 * and can never have any more or any less than this one instance.
 *
 * objects can extend classes and implement interfaces. In doing so, they are effectively singleton instances
 * of parent classes, exactly as expected.
 * This can be very useful for cases where we have a stateless implementation and thereâ€™s no need for
 * creating a new instance every time.
